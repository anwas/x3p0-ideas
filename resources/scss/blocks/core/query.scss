// Block fixes.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This is really a fix for the Template Part block, but in this case, it's
// specific to the use of the Query Loop block within our custom Loop template
// part. When a template part is added to the page, it creates an additional
// wrapping element. This is problematic because it breaks the expected layout.
// This is doubly problematic when trying to keep single post content (which can
// have nested Query Loop blocks) and archive content in sync.
//
// There are two solutions to this problem. The first is to add yet-another-div
// wrapper in the Loop template part via the Group block. I didn't want to add
// to the divitis the theme is already suffering. ðŸ¤¢ The second solution is what
// is presented here: simply add some custom CSS to control how global padding
// works in this instance.
//
// Note that wrapping the Query Loop block within a Template Part block also
// breaks alignment in the site editor (no align controls for Query Loop).
