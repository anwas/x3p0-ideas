# X3P0 - Ideas

All the ideas I have. In a theme. _Literally every idea._ No concept is so outlandish that I won't try to wiggle it in one way or another. Except sidebars. _Sidebars were so 2010._ OK. Maybe I'll add them as an option one day.

## Minimum Gutenberg Requirement

This theme currently requires at least [Gutenberg 16.0.0 RC3](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v16.0.0-rc.3) for some features to work correctly.
