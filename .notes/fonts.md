# Fonts

Notes on font testing with the theme's design system.

## Do Not Use

- **Josefin Sans** - One of my favorite fonts, but it sits at the top of line instead of the center, throwing spacing completely off, particularly as a heading. Untested but could potentially be used with a font that is similar.
