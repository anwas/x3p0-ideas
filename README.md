# Ideas, Experiments, and Things

Beautiful...Bold..._[Insert adjective to sell you on using this theme]_. Oh, never mind all that. I could try to sway you with two-dollar words and fancy dreams, but I'll just shoot straight from the hip. So, here goes.

All the ideas I have. In a theme. **Literally every idea.**

No concept is so outlandish that I won't try to wiggle it in one way or another. Except sidebars. _Sidebars were so 2010._ OK. Maybe I'll add them one day. But com'onâ€”give your content some space to do its thing. Let it be the star of the show. Bells and whistles are for people less interesting than you.
