 * Theme URI:         https://github.com/x3p0-dev/x3p0-ideas
 * Description:       All the ideas I have. In a theme. Literally every idea. No concept is so outlandish that I won't try to wiggle it in one way or another. Except sidebars. Sidebars were so 2010. OK. Maybe I'll add them as an option one day.
